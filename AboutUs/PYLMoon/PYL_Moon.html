    <h2>Size</h2>
    <p><!--#begin intro-->The moon, Earth's only natural satellite, is large as moons go. It is fifth in diameter
    among planetary satellites, more than two-thirds as large as Mercury, and more than three
    times the diameter of the largest asteroid. It is, in fact, over one-fourth the size of
    the earth, with a diameter of 2160 miles<!--#end intro--> (3476 kilometers).&nbsp; </p>
    <h2>Distance</h2>
    <p>Since the moon is a relatively near neighbor, we can measure its distance easily by
    geometrical methods. The average is 238,857 miles (384,403 kilometers). </p>
    <h2>Brightness</h2>
    <p>Next to the sun, the full moon is the brightest object in the heavens. However, its
    surface is rough and brownish and reflects light very poorly. In fact, the moon is about
    the poorest reflector in the solar system. The amount of light reflected by a celestial
    object is called the <i>albedo</i> (Latin: <i>albus,</i> white). The moon relects only 7%
    of the sunlight that falls upon it, so the albedo is 0.07. </p>
    <h2>Phases</h2>
    <p>
    <applet width="300" height="335" code="MoonPhase.class" archive="MoonPhase.jar"
    align="right" hspace="20">
      <param name="cabbase" value="MoonPhase.cab"><img src="The_Moon.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="The Moon">
    </applet>
    The phases of the moon are caused by the relative positions of the earth, sun, and moon.
    The moon goes around the earth, on average, in 27 days 7 hours 43 minutes. </p>
    <p>The sun always illuminates the half of the moon facing the sun (except during lunar
    eclipses, when the moon passes thru the earth's shadow). When the sun and moon are on
    opposite sides of the earth, the moon appears &quot;full&quot; to us, a bright, round
    disk. When the moon is between the earth and the sun, it appears dark, a &quot;new&quot;
    moon. In between, the moon's illuminated surface appears to grow (wax) to full, then
    decreases (wanes) to the next new moon. </p>
    <p>The edge of the shadow (the <i>terminator</i>) is always curved, being an oblique view
    of a circle, giving the moon its familiar crescent shape. Because the &quot;horns&quot; of
    the moon at the ends of the crescent are always facing away from the setting or rising
    sun, they always point upward in the sky. It is fun to watch for paintings and pictures
    which show an &quot;impossible moon&quot; with the horns pointed downwards. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>The Far Side</h2>
    <dl>
      <i>
      <dt>I see the moon, </dt>
      <dt>The moon sees me, </dt>
      <dt>God bless the moon, </dt>
      <dt>And God bless me. </dt>
      <dd></i>- Nursery Rhyme </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>People often refer to &quot;the dark side of the moon&quot;, but there is no such
    thing. The sun shines on all sides of it in turn. However, there <b>is</b> a &quot;far
    side of the moon&quot; which is never seen from the earth. Over the eons, the
    gravitational forces of the earth have slowed down the moon's rotation about its axis
    until the rotational period exactly matches the revolution period about the earth. </p>
    <p>You can see this effect by using two round objects such as softballs. Hold one of the
    balls stationary, to represent the earth. Now move the other ball around the
    &quot;earth&quot; without twisting your wrist. You will see that people on the
    &quot;earth&quot; would see all sides of the &quot;moon&quot;. However, if you slowly spin
    the &quot;moon&quot; on its trip around the &quot;earth&quot;, you will see that you can
    time it so only one side of the &quot;moon&quot; is ever seen from the &quot;earth&quot;.
    That's why the features you see on the face of the moon never change. </p>
